The flavor of drip brew is mild and straightforward, so it lacks some complexity compared to other types of coffee. You make drip coffee via a filtration method, where hot water is poured slowly over coffee grounds held in a filter basket. Drip brewing method is popular because it requires minimal effort or knowledge to brew, and you can make it in large batches.",
